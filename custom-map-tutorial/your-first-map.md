# Your first map

Now that you know how to open the map editor and load custom maps, let's make a new map.

First, open the map editor, and create a new map by clicking File -> New.

Next, add some objects by clicking the Add Object button at the top, or by pressing Space, and selecting an object from the popup. You can also adjust the position by dragging the movement arrows.

To delete objects, select an object or group of objects and press the Delete key.

Once you have added some objects, you can save your progress by either clicking File -> Save, or by pressing Ctrl + S. When you exit the map editor, this map will now be available to select in the game creation menu when you select Custom under the Map window.

You can also export the map as text to share with others by clicking File -> Export. Once you copy text in the popup, you can now share it with others to load or modify.
