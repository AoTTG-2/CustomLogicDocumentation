# Custom Assets

The Custom Asset system allows you to add custom unity assets to the map editor that can then be synced with other players. All custom assets use the asset bundle system to load and share objects. Thus all of your custom assets will be added to a blank unity project, which is then built to an asset bundle that can be loaded by the game.
