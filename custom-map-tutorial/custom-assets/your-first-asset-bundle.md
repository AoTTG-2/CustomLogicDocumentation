# Your first Asset Bundle

First, install Unity 2023.1.17f1 using the Unity Hub: [https://unity.com/download](https://unity.com/download)

Next, download the AssetBundleExample Unity project: [https://github.com/AoTTG-2/AssetBundleExample](https://github.com/AoTTG-2/AssetBundleExample). This is a blank Unity project that contains an example cube and sphere that are assigned and built to an asset bundle.

In Unity Hub, add the AssetBundleExample project and open it using Unity 2023.1.17f1.

Right click on the Assets folder, and click Build AssetBundles. This will create a file called "example" in the Assets/Build folder. You can rename this file to whatever you like. This "example" file is your custom asset bundle, and is now ready to be added to the map editor by moving it to the Documents/Aottg2/CustomAssets folder. To move these files, open the folder in windows explorer by right-clicking the Build folder and selecting Show in Explorer.

NOTE: There will be other files such as Build or example.manifest, these should be ignored.
