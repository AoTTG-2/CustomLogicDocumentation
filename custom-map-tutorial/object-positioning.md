# Object Positioning

When you first add or select an object, you will notice three colored arrows overlaying it. This is known as the Position Gizmo, and you can hold Left Click while dragging over them in order to change the object's position.

When you select an individual object, you will also notice a panel on the right side with details about the object. This is the inspector panel, which among other things you can use to manually input position values.

There are also the Rotation and Scale gizmos, which can be toggled by clicking the Gizmo button at the top, or by pressing C. Like the position gizmo, you can use your mouse to drag over any of the colored rings or lines to change the rotation and scale. You can also use the inspector panel to manually input rotation and scale values.

The Snap feature allows you to use gizmos with certain increments, such as moving 10 units or rotating 15 degrees per mouse movement. To activate snap, click the Snap button at the top, or press G. You can modify the increments in the editor settings.&#x20;
