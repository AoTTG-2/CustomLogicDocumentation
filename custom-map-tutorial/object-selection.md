# Object Selection

We've gone over how to add objects to the game: either use the Add Object button or press Space. When you add an object, it is automatically selected and the right-hand inspector panel appears.

You can deselect objects by clicking on them again, by clicking on a different object, or by pressing Escape.

You can select an object by clicking on the physical object, or by clicking on its name in the left-hand object list panel.&#x20;

To select multiple objects, hold down LeftControl while clicking on objects, either in the list panel or in the game view. This will add objects to the selection instead of selecting only one object. You can remove individual objects from the current selection by clicking on them again while holding down LeftControl.

Finally, you can hold down LeftClick while dragging your mouse in order to select multiple objects within the drag window.&#x20;
